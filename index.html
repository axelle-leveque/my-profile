       <h1>🌸HELLO, I'M AXELLE🌸</h1>
      <img src="images/profile.jpeg"  height="500px" class="img-circle img-bordered"> 
      <p>Hey!! My name is Axelle. I was born in France 🇫🇷 and I lived there until I was 10 years old, then I moved abroad to Latin America first to Panama 🇵🇦 and then to Chile 🇨🇱. I am currently living in Cergy near Paris where I’m a student at ESSEC Business school in the global BBA program.

       <h2>✈️🌎Travelling🌎✈️</h2>
       <p>
	     I am passionate about travelling, it's one of my bigest passion. I love to travel, I have been lucky enough to be able to do so a lot in my life, especially in Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia etc. since I lived next door. 
	     This has allowed me to have a very open mind and to love discovering new cultures whether by meeting people or by visiting countries.

        <h2>🏋️‍♀️Sport🏋️‍♀️</h2>
        <p>
	    Sports are an important part of my life. I have been doing gymnastics competitively for a long time, I love skiing and I do it every chance I get, and I have tried several other sports like tennis, judo, horse riding, and dance.
       For a few years now I have been doing fitness, but I have much less time to do it now that I am studying.
